# Stress-Detection-using-Adaptive-Threshold-Methodology

A stress detection system that can identify if a person is suffering from stress or strain over a long period and advises him for a breather to reduce stress. Earlier stress detection was carried out using a defined threshold but using a fixed threshold value is not appropriate as the threshold varies from person to person. In this manuscript, we are using an adaptive threshold methodology to overcome this issue. The proposed method uses a derived set of equations which accepts facial emotions as
parameters and generate the threshold value for stress detection. The methodology followed in this manuscript is compared with static threshold methodology to find the superior process.
